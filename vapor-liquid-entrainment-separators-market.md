<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor-Liquid Entrainment Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizonal Entrainment Separators</li><li>Verticle Entrainment Separators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapor-liquid entrainment separators are devices used to separate liquid droplets from a vapor stream. Horizontal entrainment separators are designed with a horizontal orientation and are commonly used in applications where space is limited. Vertical entrainment separators, on the other hand, are designed with a vertical orientation and are used in applications where height is limited. Both types of separators effectively remove liquid droplets from vapor streams, but their design and orientation cater to different spatial constraints.</p></p>
