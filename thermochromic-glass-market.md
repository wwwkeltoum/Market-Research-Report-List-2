<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Color Change Temperature:28℃</li><li>Color Change Temperature:32℃</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermochromic glass with color change temperature of 28℃ is designed to change color at a lower temperature compared to the standard 32℃ glass. This type of glass is often used for applications where a slight temperature change can indicate a specific condition, such as in thermometers or indicators for heating or cooling systems. The color change at 28℃ offers a more sensitive and precise indication, while the 32℃ glass is more suitable for applications requiring a slightly higher temperature threshold for color change.</p></p>
