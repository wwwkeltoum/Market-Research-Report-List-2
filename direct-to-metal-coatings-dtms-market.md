<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-to-Metal Coatings (DTMs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterborne</li><li>Solventborne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-to-Metal (DTM) coatings are formulated to be applied directly onto metal surfaces, eliminating the need for a primer. Two main types of DTM coatings are waterborne and solventborne. Waterborne DTMs are environmentally friendly, containing water as the primary solvent, reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Solventborne DTMs, on the other hand, are oil-based and provide a more durable finish. Both types cater to different consumer preferences based on their performance requirements and environmental concerns.</p></p>
