<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Cycle Steam Generation</li><li>Dual Cycle Steam Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) are a type of nuclear reactor that use water as both coolant and moderator. In the Single Cycle Steam Generation market, the BWR only generates steam once before it enters the turbine to generate electricity. In the Dual Cycle Steam Generation market, the BWR produces steam twice - first in the reactor core and then in a separate heat exchanger. This allows for higher efficiency and power output compared to Single Cycle Steam Generation BWRs.</p></p>
